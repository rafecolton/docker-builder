# TODO

* code coverage
* combine Log and Logger interface types (and just generally clean up
  the `log` package)
* document exit codes
* have -q and -q -q options for quiet and REALLY quiet output
* consolidate TODO file and GitHub Issues
* "integration" specs with actual container builds - make sure it
  catches the tag\_opts issue
* DRY up the main
